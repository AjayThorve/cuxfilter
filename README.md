## AIM: CPU Baseline: Webserver loads data, receive & performs a filtering & histogramming command, and sends resulting histograms back. The baseline can use Python's Pandas library because it is one of the most common CPU dataframe libraries, and call the Python services from a NodeJS webapp to mirror a common web architecture. The result will be visualized with a simple interactive webpage, e.g., histograms with some filter buttons.
